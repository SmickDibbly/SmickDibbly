I'm a hobbyist programmer interested in C and software renderers. I am fascinated by Binary Space Partitions and Constructive Solid Geometry, and hope to some day contribute to the theory or applications thereof.



# Self-imposed constraints
A lot of my code has restrictions that are self-imposed, for no reason other than to challenge myself. These include:
- Minimal use of compiler-specific extensions. I try to write pedantically C99-conforming code.
- Minimal use of floating point types. I rather prefer fixed-point integer arithmetic because it forces me to very carefully keep track of the values.
- No math.h from the C standard library.

I'm not *too* strict about always adhering to all of the above constraints. Often I start with whatever can be written quickest, and then later go back and make it conform to my constraints.
